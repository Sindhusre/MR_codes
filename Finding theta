function theta= rotatedtheta(R)
% R is the rotation matrix belong to SO(3)
% it is importatnt to check whether the R is identity matrix
% and the trace of R is -1
% if non of them satisfies then the theta is found using the formula
I=[1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1]
R=[2 0 1; 1 0 2 ; 1 1 0]
trace=R(1,1)+R(2,2)+R(3,3)
if I== R
    fprintf('theta is 0')
    else if  trace==-1
        fprintf('theta is pi degrees')
    else
     theta= acos((trace-1)/2)
     
    end
end
% the that we got is equal to 1.0472rad
